The application allows users to interact with planet records and includes user authentication, ensuring only authorized users can modify the data. The app also supports exporting the planet data to a PDF format.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, delete, and view planet data.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Database Interaction**: MySQL database to store planet data.
- **PDF Export**: Export the planet data as a PDF.
- **Responsive**: Designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Requirements

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher.
- **MySQL**: Version 5.7 or higher.
- **XAMPP/WAMP or similar local server**: To run PHP and MySQL.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Planet CRUD app locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/bkyncl/Planet_CRUD.git

### 2. Move Files to Local Server Directory

Move the `Planet_CRUD` folder to your local serverâ€™s root directory:

- For **XAMPP**: `C:\xampp\htdocs\Planet_CRUD\`
- For **WAMP**: `C:\wamp64\www\Planet_CRUD\`

### 3. Create Database and User

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
2. Create a new database called `astronomy_db`.
3. Create a new MySQL user with the following credentials:
   - **Username**: `student1`
   - **Password**: `pass`
4. Grant the user full permissions on the `astronomy_db` database.

Alternatively, you can run these SQL queries in phpMyAdmin or via MySQL command line:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE astronomy_db;

CREATE USER 'student1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON astronomy_db.* TO 'student1'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

### 4. Start Your Local Server

- For **XAMPP**: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
- For **WAMP**: Start WAMP and ensure the icon is green, indicating that both Apache and MySQL are running.

### 5. Access the App

In your browser, visit: http://localhost/Planet_CRUD/

### 6. Login and Use the App

- Login using the username **`student1`** and password **`pass`**.
- You can now create, read, update, delete, and export planet data to a PDF.
